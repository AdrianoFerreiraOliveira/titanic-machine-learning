<h1>Titanic Data Science Project</h1>

<p>This repository contains a Data Science project I developed with the goal of analyzing and visualizing a dataset, and creating a predictive model.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset chosen for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about Titanic passengers and is often used in Data Science projects to predict passenger survival based on their attributes.</p>

<h2>Repository Files</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>titanic_data.csv</code>: The original dataset.</li>
  <li><code>titanic_analysis.ipynb</code>: Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code used for data analysis and visualization.</li>
  <li><code>titanic_model.ipynb</code>: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used to train and evaluate the predictive model.</li>
  <li><code>titanic_model.pkl</code>: The trained predictive model saved as a .pkl file.</li>
  <li><code>README.md</code>: The file you are reading now.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Analysis and Visualization</h2>

<p>The <code>titanic_analysis.ipynb</code> file contains all the code used for data analysis and visualization. In this notebook, I explored the dataset by checking data quality, removing duplicates, and handling missing data. Additionally, I created charts and tables to visualize data distribution across various attributes and analyzed the correlation between attributes.</p>

<h2>Predictive Model</h2>

<p>The <code>titanic_model.ipynb</code> file contains the code used to train and evaluate the predictive model. In this notebook, I used a logistic regression algorithm to predict passenger survival based on their attributes. I evaluated model accuracy using cross-validation and created a confusion matrix to visualize model performance.</p>

<p>The trained model was saved as <code>titanic_model.pkl</code> for future use.</p>

<h2>How to Run the Code</h2>

<p>To run the code on your local machine, you need to have Python and the required packages installed. To install the packages, run the following command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>

<p>Once the packages are installed, you can run the Jupyter notebooks by executing the following command:</p>

<pre><code>jupyter notebook</code></pre>

<p>This will open a browser window with all the notebooks in the repository. You can open and execute the notebooks in the order listed above.</p>
